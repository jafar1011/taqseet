## 📋 Overview – Installments Management System (Still in Early Development)

The **Installments App** is a Windows Forms application developed in **C#**, designed to manage and track installment payments for subscribers. It uses simple **.txt file records** to store individual subscriber data and automatically checks for overdue updates based on date comparisons.

This tool is ideal for small-scale subscription-based services, educational institutions, or clubs that need a lightweight, offline solution to monitor monthly payments or updates.
